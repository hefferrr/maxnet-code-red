Code Red
This is my first MaxNet script I am sharing publicly so please don't judge it too much and critique every single detail of it. I know technically that this isn't a virus as it doesn't spread from PC to PC (wish it could) but I've called it a virus because it sounds like I am pro hacker despite being the furthest thing from one.

What is Code Red?
Code Red is a manually executed MaxNet virus that causes the victim to die inside. This is done by abusing the 50 letter long character limit when creating a file/directory so the victim will have a hard time distinguishing between each letter when they try and delete the file/directory. All files/directories included in this virus are made up with the characters "l" and "1", which are hard to tell apart from viewing it from the Console font format. Furthermore, the virus creates 101 folders and 100 files (maximum files/folders allowed on a maxnet PC) on the victims PC, potentially fucking their MaxNet account for a while. Although not perfect, Code Red is probably the most aids MaxNet virus created using MnScript.

Code Red can mess up someone's MaxNet experience in multiple ways, such as:
-   Deletes all files including .exe, .msc, .mscx and other file format files from the victims PC.
-   Prevents the user from creating, using and downloading files from their computer.
-   Makes it difficult for the user to delete all files/directories on their PC due to the long 50 character filenames.

Why are you doing this you horrible person?
uMM.... I got kinda bored and made this in like 3-4 hours. It's like 700 lines long, as well all viruses on CG are boring and only delete files from the victims PC which is kinda boring, so I made the ultimate dick move and made a virus which could ruin a player's maxnet account for a while.

Can I have it?
Yes, its free. The uncompressed file will be below (supports only .mscx * .msc file type)


How do I use it on someone's PC?
1. Create a .mscx file on the victims PC and name the file anything you want. For example "file create virus.mscx"
2. Open the file by typing "file open virus.mscx" and paste the code below.
3. Save the file (CTRL + S) and execute the file by typing "mnscript exec virus.mscx"
4. Wait for it to work, it takes like 1-2 minutes.
